1. Vulnerability calls vulnerability (vulnerability loop)
If I tell you I need you and am in the shit, it’s easier to approach me and help than if I’m not sharing my weaknesses and look unvulnerable. 

If I tell you about my family and share vulnerabilities, most people will share too at their turn. Then it can create trust. 

Not the other way around (trust that allows vulnerability. It’s not like that)
