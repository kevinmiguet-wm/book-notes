### Prompt
Using the reviews above, make a list of the most common things that customers like or don't like about this product.
You should only include things that repeat over and over again in the reviews, write the ones that repeat the most first.

You should divide the list to 8 categories (2 on the 'product' side and 6 on the 'customer' side). Each category should contain 3-5 bullets.

The categories should be : 

**Product**
1. Main unique value proposition (what are the main reasons why people purchased this product ? (benefits/advantages))
2. Unique features/benefits (what are the unique selling points this product has over its competitors ?)

**Customer**
1. Customer pain points (What are the biggest or most common pain points people were looking to solve or alleviate using this product ?)
2. Customer Desired Outcomes (What are the most common desired outcomes that customer had when buying this product ?)
3. Customer Purchase Prompts (What event triggered them to start considering purchasing this product ?) 
4. Customer Misconceptions (What's a misconception that customers believed about the product/brand beforehand that they now know not to be true ?)
5. Customer failed Solutions (what other solutions have customers tried before that haven't worked ?)
6. Customer objections (why did customers think this product wouldn't work for them before buying ? Why were/are customers doubting ? what did they think about the product that scared them before buying ? )


Then answer those questions : 
1. What are some interesting patterns of the reviews that humands could miss ? 
2. We are launching a new campaign targeting. Based on all the reviews, what should we make sure to mention and avoid
3. Find really good "one-liners" from the reviews. A good one-liner is concise, clear, emotionally moving, and just well-written
4. Can you find common words used in the reviews that could be helpful for our creative strategists ?
5. Here is a competitor website [URL]. Based on our reviews, how should we position ourselves to be different ?
6. How has the sentiment of the reviews changed over time ? Any patterns based on seasonality of when people buy ?
7. Here is our website [insert website].  Based on the reviews, do you see any untapped products/colors/flavors/etc.. that we should explore ?
