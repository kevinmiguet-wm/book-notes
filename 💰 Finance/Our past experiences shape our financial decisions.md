You can read about finance. Yet some decisions will still be shaped by your personal experiences, that may or may not fit the reality, may or may not serve you. 


Most of us shape our economic vision in our 20’s.

Some lessons can’t be learnt in any other way than experience. Based on this, you may acquire good or bad financial habits. 



That’s maybe one of the reasons why most poors stay poor and why rich stay rich. 

I hope beeing aware of this is the first step to be free from those bad habits, and take better decisions
